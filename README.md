# Week4 - Practical: R markdown

Here is this week's exercise:

Have a look at the GitHub course repository issue. The work below should be done as part of a GitHub repository.

1. Download, read through and knit the attached R markdown file (R_Rstudio_Rmarkdown.Rmd) to pdf. This is to ensure you are able to output pdfs, which you will need to submit your final report.
2. Create a new R markdown file.
3. Create at least two code chunks in between your text. (It can be any text and any code, it doesn't need to be meaningful.)
4. In your text, add section headers, and at least one numbered list and one unordered list.

Remember to tick off each item on the course repository issue as you complete them!
