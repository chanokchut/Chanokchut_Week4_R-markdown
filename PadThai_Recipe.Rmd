You've probably had pad thai in your local restaurant, but what you had may not be anything like the authentic version. First, it should not have ketchup or any tomato product in it. Second, it should not be syrupy sweet. And finally, it shouldn't be just a heavy, soggy clump of noodles with bits of green onions.

7. Add the soaked noodles.
8. Add the sauce.
9. Toss until the noodles have absorbed all the sauce.
10. Push the noodles to one side and add the eggs to the space you've made and break the yolks.
11. Put the noodles on top of the eggs and let it cook for 15-30 seconds.
12. Flip and toss to mix.
13. Add the peanuts, bean sprouts and garlic chives.
14. Turn off the heat and toss until the beansprouts are incorporated and slightly wilted.
15. Plate and top with more peanuts and shrimp.
16. Don't forget to add fresh lime before eating!
